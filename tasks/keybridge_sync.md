# 🔁 KEYBRIDGE_PLATFORM_SYNC

## Purpose: Fully sync all platforms (GitHub, StackBlitz, Supabase, Vercel) with the current project state.

## Mode: SAFE — No destructive actions allowed. AI agent must protect the project's core.

# KEYBRIDGE_PLATFORM_SYNC — Permanent Protocol File

## Purpose

Ensure cross-platform sync (Supabase, GitHub, StackBlitz, Vercel) without damaging hand-written or human-crafted logic. All AI actions must follow protocol.

## Workflow

* Supabase schema must match project logic
* GitHub is source-of-truth for `.env`, `vercel.json`, `bolt.yaml`
* StackBlitz must reflect GitHub HEAD
* `.gitignore` must filter sensitive/dev clutter

## Rules for Codex/Bolt AI:

* ❌ Never touch app logic unless explicitly instructed
* 🤖 Recognize own limits and **ask** if unsure
* 🔁 Run Git pull before any overwrite action
* 🛡️ KEYBRIDGE always protects resonance-aligned structure
* 🚀 Only push clean, verified changes unless `--force` used
