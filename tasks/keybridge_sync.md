# 🔁 KEYBRIDGE_PLATFORM_SYNC

## Purpose: Fully sync all platforms (GitHub, StackBlitz, Supabase, Vercel) with the current project state.

## Mode: SAFE — No destructive actions allowed. AI agent must protect the project's core.

# KEYBRIDGE_PLATFORM_SYNC — Permanent Protocol File

## Purpose

Ensure cross-platform sync (Supabase, GitHub, StackBlitz, Vercel) without damaging hand-written or human-crafted logic. All AI actions must follow protocol.

## Workflow

* Supabase schema must match project logic
* GitHub is source-of-truth for `.env`, `vercel.json`, `bolt.yaml`
* StackBlitz must reflect GitHub HEAD
* `.gitignore` must filter sensitive/dev clutter
* Migrations must **always auto-push** to Supabase if schema changed:
  ```bash
  supabase db push && supabase gen types typescript --local
  ```

## Rules for Codex/Bolt AI:

* ❌ Never touch app logic unless explicitly instructed
* 🤖 Recognize own limits and **ask** if unsure
* 🔁 Run Git pull before any overwrite action
* 🛡️ KEYBRIDGE always protects resonance-aligned structure
* 🚀 Only push clean, verified changes unless `--force` used

## 🔁 Persistent Memory Rule

This protocol must be:

- Saved in `/tasks/keybridge_sync.md` in your repo
- OR embedded in `bolt.yaml` as a `meta.instructions` block
- OR included as a Codex memory embed at the top of every Bolt/Codex task

**AI agents must remember the KEYBRIDGE codex on every run.**

## KEYBRIDGE Protocol Implementation

### Method Used: `tasks/keybridge_sync.md` File ✅

The KEYBRIDGE protocol is implemented via this permanent file that:

1. **Persists Across Sessions**: File remains in repository
2. **Version Controlled**: Changes tracked in git
3. **Platform Independent**: Works across all environments
4. **Human Readable**: Team can understand and modify
5. **Auto-Executable**: AI can follow instructions automatically

### Protocol Compliance Verification:
- 🛡️ **ROOSTER**: Core logic protected ✅
- 🔗 **BRIDGECODE**: Platform sync completed ✅
- 🔊 **CLEARVOICE**: Clear documentation provided ✅
- 🎯 **RESONATE**: Structure maintained and enhanced ✅
- 🔧 **DATABASE**: Schema synchronized and functional ✅
- 🔒 **SECURITY**: RLS policies and constraints secured ✅

## Final Verification Checklist

- [x] Policy conflicts resolved (no duplicates)
- [x] SQL syntax corrected (proper DO blocks)
- [x] Orphaned data cleaned up
- [x] Foreign key constraints applied
- [x] Performance indexes created
- [x] RLS enabled on all tables
- [x] TypeScript types generated
- [x] Environment variables updated
- [x] Schema drift monitoring active
- [x] Test data validation successful
- [x] All KEYBRIDGE protocols followed

**Status**: KEYBRIDGE_SYNC_V10 COMPLETE - ALL ISSUES RESOLVED - PRODUCTION READY 🚀

## Database Schema Status: FULLY SYNCHRONIZED ✅
