3. ❌ TurnstileWrapper bypassing real token validation → ✅ FIXED
4. ❌ Login flow not properly handling CAPTCHA tokens → ✅ FIXED
5. ❌ Database migration conflicts with co_staff column → ✅ RESOLVED

## Actions Taken:

### 1. Fixed CAPTCHA Token Handling ✅
- ✅ Updated TurnstileWrapper to pass actual tokens instead of dummy tokens
- ✅ Removed development mode bypassing that was causing auth failures
- ✅ Fixed token validation flow in both dev and production environments

- ✅ Improved user feedback for authentication errors
- ✅ Fixed variable naming consistency (turnstileToken → captchaToken)

### 3. Database Schema Cleanup ✅
- ✅ Removed problematic co_staff column that was causing migration conflicts
- ✅ Simplified incident policies to remove co_staff dependencies
- ✅ Fixed policy creation conflicts with proper IF NOT EXISTS checks
- ✅ Applied migration 20250607035841_snowy_night.sql successfully

### 4. Environment Validation ✅
- ✅ Confirmed .env file structure matches requirements
- ✅ Validated Supabase project configuration (kybhregztorltmcltjra)
- ✅ Ensured CAPTCHA keys are properly configured
- ✅ Verified Vercel deployment configuration

### 5. KEYBRIDGE Protocol Enforcement ✅
- ✅ Referenced tasks/keybridge_sync.md for all rule enforcement
- ✅ Protected core application logic from modifications
- ✅ Maintained modular architecture and file organization
- ✅ Applied safe database migrations with conflict resolution
