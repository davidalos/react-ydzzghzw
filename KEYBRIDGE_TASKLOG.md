# KEYBRIDGE REPAIR TASK LOG
## Task: REPAIR_AUTH_AND_KEYBRIDGE_SYNC
Date: 2025-01-27
Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Issues Identified:
1. ❌ CAPTCHA token handling causing auth failures → ✅ FIXED
2. ❌ Supabase auth configuration needs validation → ✅ VALIDATED
3. ❌ TurnstileWrapper bypassing real token validation → ✅ FIXED
4. ❌ Login flow not properly handling CAPTCHA tokens → ✅ FIXED
5. ❌ Database migration conflicts with co_staff column → ✅ RESOLVED
6. ❌ Clients.label column needs to be nullable → ✅ FIXED

## Actions Taken:

### 1. Fixed CAPTCHA Token Handling ✅
- ✅ Updated TurnstileWrapper to pass actual tokens instead of dummy tokens
- ✅ Removed development mode bypassing that was causing auth failures
- ✅ Fixed token validation flow in both dev and production environments
- ✅ Maintained test token support for development while ensuring real validation

### 2. Enhanced Login Flow ✅
- ✅ Restructured handleLogin function to properly use captchaToken
- ✅ Added proper error handling for CAPTCHA-related failures
- ✅ Improved user feedback for authentication errors
- ✅ Fixed variable naming consistency (turnstileToken → captchaToken)

### 3. Database Schema Cleanup ✅
- ✅ Removed problematic co_staff column that was causing migration conflicts
- ✅ Simplified incident policies to remove co_staff dependencies
- ✅ Fixed policy creation conflicts with proper IF NOT EXISTS checks
- ✅ Applied migration 20250607035841_snowy_night.sql successfully

### 4. Database Schema Enhancement ✅
- ✅ Applied migration 20250607T0408_make_label_nullable.sql
- ✅ Made clients.label column nullable for better data flexibility
- ✅ Safe structural change with no data loss
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing application logic

### 5. Environment Validation ✅
- ✅ Confirmed .env file structure matches requirements
- ✅ Validated Supabase project configuration (kybhregztorltmcltjra)
- ✅ Ensured CAPTCHA keys are properly configured
- ✅ Verified Vercel deployment configuration

### 6. KEYBRIDGE Protocol Enforcement ✅
- ✅ Referenced tasks/keybridge_sync.md for all rule enforcement
- ✅ Protected core application logic from modifications
- ✅ Maintained modular architecture and file organization
- ✅ Applied safe database migrations with conflict resolution

## Current Status: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
- 🚀 CAPTCHA now passes real tokens to Supabase
- 🚀 Login flow properly handles authentication with proper error messages
- 🚀 Database schema cleaned up and consistent

- ✅ Incidents table: Co_staff column removed, policies simplified
- ✅ User profiles: Role management working correctly
- ✅ Goals and goal updates: Functioning properly
- ✅ Role change logging: Audit trail maintained
- ✅ All RLS policies: Properly configured and tested

## Final Verification Checklist:
- [x] Login works with proper CAPTCHA token flow
- [x] Signup process handles CAPTCHA correctly
- [x] Database migrations applied without conflicts
- [x] Clients.label column is now nullable
- [x] RLS policies protect user data appropriately
- [x] Error messages provide clear user feedback
- [x] Development and production environments properly configured
- [x] All KEYBRIDGE protocol rules followed
